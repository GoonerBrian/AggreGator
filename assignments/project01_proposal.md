## Product name and description

> [AggreGator](https://github.com/acapellan/AggreGator) is a web-based service for the University of Floridaâ€™s students, professors, and alumni that provides a forum for preparing for upcoming courses, performing well in current courses, and remaining up-to-date on the latest industry trends. Gators are able to discuss, ask questions, share material, and encourage each other to achieve their goals in the classroom and boardroom. Unlike other services, [AggreGator](https://github.com/acapellan/AggreGator) is a unique service designed specifically for Gators. 

## Languages & Tools for Project Build

### Backend

Our group will be using CISE [Oracle Database Management System](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/) (DBMS). 

### Frontend

Our group will be creating a single page application frontend using [React](https://reactjs.org/), and styling with a Bootstrap-related framework called [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

### Communication

To run our application and have communication between the frontend and backend, we will use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework for web-applications, along with [npm 8.1.2](https://www.npmjs.com/) for CRUD operations. To connect the database to our instance of [CISE Oracle DBMS](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/), we will use the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) connector [node oracledb ver 5.2](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html#oracle), which is the most up-to-date library which provides an API to our application. [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) will be used for ease of styling. For an IDE, our group has agreed to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Challenge Statement

Our product addresses the third challenge statement: **#3 Teacher and/or student resource**. Our product will provide a service for students, teachers, and alumni at the University of Florida that allows ease of planning for courses, sharing material that is conducive to successful semesters, and provides a forum in which Gators can have discussions aimed to progress student educational enrichment. 

## Product Vision
