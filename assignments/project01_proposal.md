## Product Name and Description

[AggreGator](https://github.com/acapellan/AggreGator) is a web-based service for the University of Floridaâ€™s students, professors, and alumni that provides a forum for preparing for upcoming courses, performing well in current courses, and remaining up-to-date on the latest industry trends. Gators are able to discuss, ask questions, share material, and encourage each other to achieve their goals in the classroom and boardroom. Unlike other services, [AggreGator](https://github.com/acapellan/AggreGator) is a unique service designed specifically for Gators. 

## Languages & Tools for Project Build

### Backend

Our group will be using CISE [Oracle Database Management System](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/) (DBMS). 

### Frontend

Our group will be creating a single page application frontend using [React](https://reactjs.org/), and styling with a Bootstrap-related framework called [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

### Communication

To run our application and have communication between the frontend and backend, we will rely on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the server framework [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). To connect the database to our CISE instance of [Oracle DBMS](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/), we will use a library provided by [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for [database integration](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html#oracle). [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) will be used for CSS styling. For an IDE, our group has agreed to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and we will adopt a common coding [formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to maintain consistency across our codebase.

## Challenge Statement

Our product addresses the third challenge statement: **#3 Teacher and/or student resource**. Our product will provide a service for students, teachers, and alumni at the University of Florida that allows ease of planning for courses, sharing material that is conducive to successful semesters, and provides a forum in which Gators can have discussions aimed to progress student educational enrichment. 

## Product Vision Statement
